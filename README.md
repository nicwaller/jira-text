Export JIRA database to text files

Why? Sometimes you have an old JIRA database lying around and you don't want to maintain the server any more. All you want is the issue history in an easily greppable format. And you're using some version from before they introduced the REST API in 5.0. Or you have access to the database but you aren't a JIRA user. For any or all of these reasons, you might want to export directly from the database into text files.

Will support both plaintext and JSON output.
